Prompt for Building a Minimalist Professional File Downloader

Objective:
Build a minimalist, professional web application that allows users to download audio, video (mp4), text, or other supported files directly via inputted URLs.

Core Tech Stack:

React.js with Vite for fast builds and modern DX.

Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling with minimalist UI.

shadcn/ui for clean, reusable components (input, buttons, cards, modals).

lucide-react for icons (download, link, file types).

framer-motion for subtle animations and microinteractions.

Axios (or Fetch API) for handling downloads.

file-saver (npm package) for saving files locally.

Core Features

URL Input Field

Clean, centered input box for users to paste a file URL.

Detects file type by extension (.mp4, .mp3, .txt, .pdf, etc.).

File Preview & Info (Optional)

Show detected file type with an icon (video, audio, text, generic file).

Display filename (parsed from URL) and approximate size (if accessible via headers).

Download Controls

Large, minimalist Download button.

Option to choose download type (direct/raw vs. converted formats if applicable).

Minimalist UI/UX

White/neutral background, centered card layout, professional font (e.g., Inter).

Rounded containers with soft shadows (rounded-2xl shadow-lg).

Animations: smooth fade-ins for components, button hover scaling.

Error Handling

If a URL is invalid or file is unsupported, show a subtle red toast/alert.

Retry button if download fails.

Download History (Optional)

Store previous downloads in localStorage.

Display last 3–5 downloads in a small sidebar or dropdown.
